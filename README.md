# FREELY

## DESCRIPTION

I developed Freely, a blog application designed to simplify the way users create, manage, and share content. With its user-friendly design, Freely enables *editors* to effortlessly create posts, categorize them, and upload images using an integrated cropping feature. For *viewers*, it offers a seamless experience to browse posts, filter them by categories, and enjoy beautifully designed layouts. Built using Flutter with the ***GetX*** state management package, Freely is connected to Firebase for authentication, Firestore for data storage, and Firebase Storage for handling images, ensuring a reliable and secure platform for all users.

The app uses Firebase Authentication for login, *Firestore* for storing data, and *Firebase Storage* for managing images, ensuring data security and reliability.
